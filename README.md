# Welcome to PARCS!

**PARCS** (Parking and Automobile Reservation Companion System) aims to solve an existing problem that exists in the Saint Louis University MaryHeights Campus - **parking.**

With the uncertainty and influx of parking slots available on the campus, students are left with a lack of security in securing a parking slot. This leads to many hovering around parked cars hoping that they would leave soon, desperate trips around the parking looking for a slot, finding a distant parking and commuting, or what is often the case double parking and eventually receiving a ticket. All of which lead to significant *carbon emission, traffic, and an overall frustrating experience.*

The application attempts to resolve this issue by introducing a **Parking Reservation System.**
